My solutions for the [adventofcode.com](http://adventofcode.com/2016)

Trying to do them using Rust-lang, we'll see how long that goal lasts!

## Days Completed so far
* Day 1.1: Bit of a slog
* ~~Day 1.2: Fighting the borrow checker~~ 
* Day 2: Used copy trait and a mutable var
* Day 3: Terrible shame about step_n() func
* Day 4.1: Imported a regex crate and became horribly confused with Strings vs &str
* Day 4.2: Zomg u8 vs u16 grrr
* Day 5.1: Cheeky BTreeMap
* Day 5.2: Awesome animation, so l33t
* Day 6: Penny slowly dropping about borrowing. Slowly.
* Day 7: RTFM
